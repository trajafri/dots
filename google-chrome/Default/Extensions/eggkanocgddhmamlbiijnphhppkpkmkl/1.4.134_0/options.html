                    because of possible hard disk fail, lost notebooks, thieves, fire,  flood, kids, terrorist attacks,
                    unexpected revolution with the following war and so on,  the Chrome local storage (a place where
                    Tabs Outliner stores the tree data in the Free Mode),  is very unreliable, and can be lost or cleared
                    any moment for many different reasons,  most often during the Chrome automatic updates or sudden crash.
                    You can find a lot of such stories in the reviews section of  any  Chrome extension that depend on a local storage.
                <p>
                So, if you even slightly value your data, please Upgrade to the Paid Mode and enable automatic backup. They save you from a lot of troubles and worries,
                and, what's more important, without your payments we will not be able to move the project forward on its father progress.
                <p>
                <h3>Backup features that will be available in the Paid Mode</h3>
                <ul>
                <li>Automaticaly performed once per day backup of the tree to your Google Drive account.
                <li>Possibility to initiate Google Drive backup manually at any time.
                <li>Local snapshots of the tree created automatically every 5-15 minutes, for restoring deleted hierarchies or windows created after the last Google drive backup.
                <li>Backup files will also be possible to open remotely, from any Tabs Outliner instance installed in your
                    Chrome Profile. Then drag and drop hierarchies from them to the main tree for import or reopen some
                    links directly from the backup. 
                </ul>
                <p>
                Note that Google Drive backups enable some form of remote access to your data. Yet it's not the final point,
                fully synchronized in both directions and real-time implementation, which will replace all of this different
                type of backups, is still planned and in development now.
                <p>
                Worth to note that backups created by Tabs Outliner do not pass through any of our transit servers (in contrast with
                many other similar tools) and goes directly into your Google Drive Account. So your private information stays private.

                Local backup snapshots created much more often then Google Drive daily backups. They are useful to restore
                accidentally deleted hierarchies or unintentionaly closed windows, created in the tree after the last daily backup.

                <b>Important tip for users with very big trees.</b> With very big tree (tens of thousands of nodes),
                Tabs Outliner becomes slow and unresponsive. If you experience long pauses and slow operations,
                it's recommended to export your tree to a file, to archive its content, and start from scratch,
                with an empty tree, to restore normal performance.  <span class="showMoreContent" name='tipForUserWithBigTree'>MORE...</span>

                <div id="tipForUserWithBigTree" style='display:none'>
                You can reset the tree by uninstalling Tabs Outliner and then installing it's again. Uninstall deletes all local data (but not the backups on Google Drive). Make sure you exported the older tree before uninstall, and, just to be safe, create a backup of it to Google Drive (this will also enable remote access to the older tree,  but take note that older backups become automatically deleted after reaching configured here maximum number of stored files). Also, please check that you can successfully open the exported file before uninstalling Tabs Outliner.
                <p>
                The problem with bad performance on big trees is one of the highest priorities to solve, and the whole Paid Mode was introduced to a great extent to be able to fund the architecture changes that will enable good performance with any amount of stored data.  But, just archiving the content and start from scratch can quickly solve this problem for you now.
                <p>
                We also plan to make possible import such exported files back as separate documents, to make trees in them editable again and enable access to them through Google Drive.
                </div>

                <h2>Tips</h2>
                <ul>
                <li>To import back hierarchies from Backup or Exported File, Drag&Drop them (the hierarchies) to the main Tabs Outliner window.
                    You can import the whole tree by dragging its root node.
                    So, for example, to restore a complete tree from a backup, into the fresh instance of Tabs Outliner
                    on a new PC, drag and drop the root node of the backed up tree, from the Backup View,
                    into the Tabs Outliner's Main Window.

                <li>Links can be opened directly from Backup View with Ctrl-Click (Middle-Click) or Shift-Click, as Backup view is just an a regular HTML page.
                (This shortcuts also works in Main View).

                <li>To <b>delete all</b> Tabs Outliner backup files from Google Drive or check ocupied by them space:
                <ol>
                  <li>Go to <a href="https://drive.google.com" target="_blank">drive.google.com</a>.</li>
                  <li>In the top right, click the settings icon <img src="./img/cog.png"
                      style="margin-top: -17px; margin-bottom: -7px;"                  height="auto">.</li>
                  <li>Select <strong>Settings</strong>.</li>
                  <li>Choose <strong>Manage Apps</strong>.</li>
                  <li>Find Tabs Outliner entry. All backup data can be deleted using the Options drop down menu of Tabs Outliner's entry.</li>

                <h2>Realtime Cloud Backup</h2>

                <b>Under construction.</b>
                <p>
                A few words about all of this different backup modes and why it’s done the way it’s done.
                <p>
                Google Drive automatic backups cannot be created meantime more often than once per day because of the
                quotas exposed by Google Drive on Tabs Outliner (and any other) extension. To overcome this limitations
                and to be able to restore incidental deletions of the items created in the tree AFTER the last daily backup (which
                hapens only once per 24 hours) there is Local Backups, which happens more often.
                And also the Backup Now functionality to manualy initiates snd save backup of the current
                tree, with all the recent changes, to the Google Drive.
                <p>
                Backup Now feature enables possibility to access remotely the very last changes in the tree. Automatic backup functionality
                performs backup once per 24 hours and thus the latest automatic backup will unlikely contain the most recent changes.
                For example, when you go from work to home and want ensure that you have the latest copy of
                the tree on the Google Drive, to be able to review it from home (and, soon, from mobile devices) you need to
                press Backup Now before leaving your office to store the latest tree on your Google Drive and to be able view it from home.
                <p>
                But of course all of this is not as handy as it can be. It will be much better not to keep in mind that you need
                to press Backup Now before going to home.
                For this all changes must be automatically transmited to the cloud, continuously,
                so the cloud copy will always be synchronized and up date.
                We are working on this functionality, it’s largely done, but unfortunately still not
                ready to be presented for a general public. Your payments is what will help finish it completely, along
                with many other features.
                This feature will also give possibility to “rewind” the tree to any point of the past, thus providing an alternative for Undo and
                some insights of the browsing process through the past days and weeks.
                <p>
                But, as Realtime Cloud Backup feature will seriously utilize server side equipments, it most likely will require some subscription payments.
                <p>
                So, the current simple backup functionality, despite being somewhat "oldschool", have rights to exist and have own usefulness for users
                who will prefer not to commit on any subscription payments, as it's still cover most of the problems with data loss for chrome extensions.

            <div class="option-comment">
                Many asks for this option, thus it is available, but it <b>not recomended</b> to enable it. That's why:
                <p>
                <ul>
                <li >You will lose a possibility to select quickly (bring to front) already opened and partially visible Tabs Outliner window,
                    by clicking almost anywhere inside it (as this will always result in some additional actions).

                <li>One click navigation prone for accidental clicks, for example during drag and drop operations, and this might lead to a
                    lot of undesirable consequences, like unintentional restoring of saved windows with many tabs and so on.

                <li>It's not very friendly for keyboard operations (in Paid Mode), as to utilize them it's handy to have the ability to set
                    keyboard cursor on any node just by clicking on it.

                </ul>

                Tabs Outliner is not aimed to replace the original Chrome's tab bar completely.
                You actually will use the original Chrome's tabs bar to switch most of your tabs through the day.
                So even without this feature tabs will be switched by a single click most of the time.
                <p>
                Tabs Outliner is useful for a better overview, more serious manipulations of tabs hierarchies, organizing saved windows, adding notes,
                better handling of crashed sessions.
                It's goal to be more a browsing notepad and information organizer, not just a simple tabs manager.
                <p>
                In the Paid Mode enabling this options also adds additional button to the node's hovering menu:
                <img src="../../img/options/arrow_btn.png" style="display: block">
                It's allow to set keyboard cursor on the selected node by mouse click.
            </div>

            <div><input type="checkbox" id="doNotAutoscroll"> <label for="doNotAutoscroll">Do not auto-scroll the main view on active Chrome window switch. </label> </div>
            <div class="option-comment">
                After disabling auto-scroll, you still be able to spotlight the current Chrome window in the Tabs Outliner's view
                by pressing the Tabs Outliner's extension button
                <img src="../../img/help_block/open_extension_btn.png" alt="close button" style="vertical-align: middle;
                                        margin-bottom: -15px;
                                                    margin-left: 2px;
                                                    margin-right: 0px;
                                                    margin-top: -15px;">
                 - it will scroll the tree to display the current focused Chrome window and its tabs at the top of the Tabs Outliner's view.
                <!--<p>
                Small note. Disable autoscrolling is a real desire for many novice users.
                But before you do so, maybe worth to try accustomize self with the auto-scroll feature.
                For example take note that scroll does not happen if you select the window (or tab) from the
                Tabs Outliner view, it happens only when you switch windows outside the Tabs Outliner.
                Cloned views do not auto scroll at all. And there is also Undo Scroll button that can undo
                all types of scrolls.
                <p>
                The Undo Scroll is actually useful not only to undone scrolls, exist two other handy use cases:
                to scroll backwards (in reverse order) after the sequence of Scroll Up To Next Open Window button presses;
                and if pressed in a Cloned View it will scroll it to the same position as the Main View.-->
